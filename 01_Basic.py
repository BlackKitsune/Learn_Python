## Python Syntax: Variables (numbers)

# Write your code below!
my_variable = 10

# Write your code above!
print my_variable

## Python Syntax: Booleans (True, False)

# Set the variables to the values listed in the instructions!
my_int = 7
my_float = 1.23
my_bool = True

# Write your code above!
print my_int
print my_float
print my_bool

## Python Syntax: Reassign values

# my_int is set to 7 below. What do you think
# will happen if we reset it to 3 and print the result?
my_int = 7

# Change the value of my_int to 3 on line 8!
my_int = 3

# Here's some code that will print my_int to the console:
# The print keyword will be covered in detail soon!
print my_int

## Python Syntax: Whitespaces (structure the code with indentations)

# Bad Format
def spam():
eggs = 12
return eggs
        
print spam()

# Good Format(two spaces of indentation)
def spam():
  eggs = 12
  return eggs
        
print spam()
