#       2. Open a browser

# Import all necessary libraries
import time
import webbrowser

total_breaks = 1
break_count = 0

# Start to count with the current time time.ctime()
print("This program started on " + time.ctime())

# Reapeat 3 times
while (break_count < total_breaks):
    # Wait for a number of seconds
    time.sleep(7200)
    # Open the browser
    webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngzC_8zqInk")
    # Increase the counter
    break_count = break_count + 1
